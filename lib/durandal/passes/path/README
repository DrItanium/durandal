This folder contains multiple pass types for path generation. 

The all folder contains the paths pass which will generate a list of paths for
_all_ regions in a function.

The constrained folder contains the paths-conditional pass which will only
generate a list of paths for a given path if it has been marked to be
pathed by another pass in a group. The prior pass is responsible for generating
messages with the action valid-pathing-target. For example:

(assert (message (to paths-conditional) 
			        (from <originating-pass>)
					  (action valid-pathing-target)
					  (arguments <region-name>)))

Do not lump multiple arguments together because this is not how the rules in
path-conditional match.
