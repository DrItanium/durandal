This document provides an indepth (and ongoing) representation of my thought
process while designing the hydra pass. 

The idea behind this pass comes from a point in my thesis where I had to curb
extended memory analysis due to the fact that it was a thesis in itself with
the amount of work that would be required. 

However, now that my thesis is finished and I have free time, I have decided to
start writing the full hydra pass. Like most other passes I've written in
CLIPS, this pass operates on a full function at a time.
