With durandal it's possible to define passes that will interact with the ones
defined by LLVM. These passes are created on demand but the definition of them
is done once within CLIPS. 

This guide assumes that you already know enough about CLIPS to use it well.
More specifically, I assume that you know
1) How to use objects
2) Assert facts
3) Define rules
4) Use control facts
5) Of the module system


With that in mind let's talk about defining your own ExpertSystem module

Step 0: Having an idea in mind

I am assuming that you've already figured out this step yourself. If you don't
know what you're going to use the expert system pass for then this document may
be confusing

Step 1: Create a new folder and define the pass 

One of the limitations of CLIPS is that it doesn't understand the concept of a
library path. Thus it is necessary to create a new folder in
lib/durandal/modules/llvm/passes with a the title you want the pass to be. 

Inside of this folder you're going to want to create a new file where we are
going to define the entry point into the pass. To make it really easy to find
again it is a good idea to name this file PassHeader.clp.

Inside of this file you're going to want to add the following command
