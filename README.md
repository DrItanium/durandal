This program is a generic tool that allows one to use the power of an expert
system to do code analysis with LLVM and, eventually, other programming
languages. This tool requires that it is compiled in the projects folder of an
llvm source tree. 

It also requires that the user have access to clang libraries as well. 

There are only two tools at this point in time:

durandal - clips with the rampancy library and other llvm features added
kclang - compiles a C/C++/ObjC file into a knowledge representation


The name durandal is a homage to the AI Durandal from the video game Marathon
by Bungie.
